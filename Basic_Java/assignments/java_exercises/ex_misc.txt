1	Design classes and interface as required .

Create a  class Container that stores objects  and has various methods like.
A	addElement(int n) --- that adds an element.
	Element can be added in two ways FIFO and LIFO. So this method has two implementations which can be defined in separate child classes.(Queue and Stack)
B   removeElement()  -- removes the first element.
C	removeElement(int index)   -- removes element from the given index.

Use Arrays to store elements.
Facilitate it to accept any number of elements ie.array should be resizable.

The application should be quite extensible, so that later on a new implementation like storing elements in a sorted order has to be plugged,it should be possible without affecting the client code.
Create a client program to test these methods based on the user’s choice.

2	Create a container class (HashMap) to store key-value pairs , Where Employee object will be the key and salary will be the value.
A	put(Employee e,double salary)   --- that adds the pairs.
B	get(Employee e1)   -- display the salary of the object e1.
	The HashMap should be able to add only unique keys ie a certain employee object can exist inside the container only once.
